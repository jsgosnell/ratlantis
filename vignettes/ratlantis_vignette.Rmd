Ecoystem modeling is a growing areas of specialization. Multiple models (e.g., 
Ecopath w/ Ecosim and Ecospace, INVITRO) exist, each having their own set of strengths 
and weaknesses. However, a shared issue among these models is the the time, data,
and software needed to complete them.  These models, by their very nature, are data-
and computationally-intensive, with development times often leading to model construction
taking years to complete.  To begin to address this issue, we have developed ratlantis.

The ratlantis package is designed to allow Atlantis ecosystem models to be developed
rapidly (3-6 months is the goal, vs the 2 years projected in other documents).
It does this by

* providing access to software already designed by the Atlantis community via R, 
removing a learning curve and offering a single environment to design, execute, and 
analyze models
* using existing R packages that can pull biological, geographic, and other types of data
from public repositories to provide data needed for Atlantis models
* offering a clear framework for developing a new model or modifying an existing 
one, where users supply data, modify output, and continue model development as needed

Atlantis, originally developed by Elizabeth Fulton at CSCIRO, is an ecosystem model 
designed to simulate long-term dynamics in marine systems.  The model is spatially-
and temporally-explicit, following the dynamics of numerous ecological groups in 
irregulary-shaped polygons of various depth.  Groupings of organisms, polygon shapes, 
and depth levels are all determined by the user, and we leave the discussion of the 
implication of these decisions for other times.    Here we will go through the basic 
use and development of an Atlantis model using the ratlantis package.  While all 
steps could be completed in R, we will assume other pieces of software (table editors 
such as Excel or Sheets, GIS programs such as QGIS) are being used in the development 
workflow due to their common application.  R users interested in fully developing models
in this environment should be able to make small changes as needed.

This vignette and guide builds heavily on existing Atlantis documentation developed
by Isaac Kaplan, Elizabeth Fulton, and Cameron Ainsworth ^[How to Build an Atlantis Model:
A living document].  The CSIRO Atlantis wiki has also proved invaluable in model 
and package development.

## Atlantis Steps: Model Development

Atlantis model development consists of several key task:

* map construction
* group assignment
* procuring and formatting environmental data
* creating input for files for C++ Atlantis software

The following guide walks users through these steps using the general setup

* short version:  just what you need to provide the function
* example: example R code; files used here are available by emailing the author 
(stephen.gosnell@baruch.cuny.edu)
* longer version and explanations: lengthier overview of what Atlantis is doing
and how the functoin works


###Map Development with rbgmeriser

####Short version
Map development is handled in ratlantis by the rbgmeriser function, to which users
provide 

* name of a wgs84 formatted shape file with the area you wish to model carved into 
polygons.  The only other attribute/data you need is for each polygon to be labelled
(box_id); start at 0 and go as high as needed.  
* location of bgmeriser.jar, downloaded from Atlantis wiki; defaults to working directory
* name of a bathymetry file in wgs84 format that includes your map area and negative depths
in a column named "Contour"
* depths you want to be used for Atlantis polygons (if Depth column not included in 
shape file)
* locations of all files; defaults to working directory

Function should return a .bgm file to be used in Atlantis models.

#### Example

```r
rbgmeriser( map_name = "DeepCmap",
            boundary_boxes = c(0,52),
            get_bathymetry = TRUE,
            bathymetry_layer_name = "gom bath wgs84",
            bathymetry_cutoff = .9,
            bathymetry_levels = c(-10, -20,-50, -200,-1000, -2000,-4000)
)
```

####Longer version with explanations
As previously noted, Atlantis models are spatially-explicit.  Resolution depends on 
the size of the area being noted, but in general Atlantis most models have kept the number
of areas (polygons) under 75.   Polygons can be of any shape, 
but limiting sides and angles will help with computational time. Similarly, keeping 
polygons close to the same size is useful.  Polygons can follow similar habitat areas,
geographies, or areas of protection (reserves or fishing zones).  Once developed 
in a mapping program, you must include a box_id column (going from 0 to the maximum
number needed to number all boxes without skipping any numbers).  You MAY also include
a botz (set to the desired Atlantis depth for each polygon), horizmix, vertmix, and boundary column
- all depths should be negative (below sea level) and boundary columns should be 
set to 1 unless a box is a adjacent to open water not included in the model (in which case it is set to 0).

If Depth is not set, you must provide the downloaded location of a bathymetry shape file
that has a depth labeled as Contour (again, must be negative numbers), set 
get_bathymetry = T (default value), and list the desired depths for final model polygons 
(4-8 depths is recommended, for example in the Gulf of Mexico we set the max depth
for each polygon to -10, -20,-50, -200,-1000, -2000,-4000 meters).  The function
overlays your polygon map on the bathymetry map to get depths for each site, and the
bathymetry_cutoff functions instructs which quantile to take as the depth for each
polygon (defaults to .9 to avoid a canyon overly influencing depths).  The code then 
creates a botz column.  

If boundary is not included, you must list the box_id values of the boundary boxes 
so a boundary column can be created.  

If vertmix and horizmix are not defined, they are set to 0..00001 and 1, respectively,
by default (standard for Atlantis models).

Atlantis input requires a .shp polygon file to be transformed to a .bgm format.  
Map development is handled via the rbgmeriser function, which assumes you have downloaded
the java applet bgmeriser.jar.   

####Comments

A common error following this function is that "java is not recognized as an internal
command", etc.  This means your workstation needs to have java added to it's PATH.  
Also remember that the java path can't have any spaces in it.

###Group Assignment and Biology PRM, NC development

Atlantis models consider a variety of marine life, moving from bacterial pools to fish
and large marine mammals.  However, this scale means that in order to make simulations 
tractable (both due to computing time and information needs) organisms are divied into
functional (or focal) groups.  These groups may range from single species to larger
feeding or functional groups (e.g., reef sharks, large reef fish). Atlantis requires 
a .prm file giving data and an .nc file giving initial conditions (where they 
start in map) for each group. ratlantis helps create these groups and files using 
the following functions:

* Group creation
    * gather_group_for_species
    * gather_data_for_species
    * gather_interactions_for_species
    * gather_habitat_for_species
    * create_functional_groups
* Parameter creation
   * create_atlantis_parameters 
* Writing the prm
    * create_biology_prm

####Group creation

In order to assign organisms to appropriate groups, we'd ideally like to use as much
data as possible.  However, we are always missing data and the time needed to find 
it  For those reason, ratlantis automates 3 basic types of data that may be used 
iteratively to create functional groups.

* gather_group_for_species takes a basic scientific name (Genus species) and compiles
data on higher classifications.  These can be used to look for missing information 
needed for model or to supply Atlantis group types

* gather_data_for_species pulls data on basic life history and ecological traits 
(age, size, trophic level, harvested).

* gather_interactions_for_species uses rglobi to pull species interaction data from
the Global Biotic Interaction Database.

* gather_habitat_for_species provides occurence data and notes on preferrered habitats.

* create_functional_groups uses data provided by user (via gather_ functions if needed)

These functions are separated as they have slightly different requirements and may 
be best run in different orders depending on existing data.  If an external species
list is present, you can use them in the order stated above.  However, if an external list
is not present, one option may be to run the gather_interactions_for_species function, 
which returns information on interactions (and thus species) documented for the area,
and then use this list to run the gather_data and gather_habitat functions.

#####gather_group_for_species
######Short version
Provide 

* name and location (defaults to working directory) of a .csv file that has a list of species to be included. File needs to have columns labelled
    * Genus
    * species
    * common_name
    These may be blank for some speciesbut column must be included

Function should return a .csv file with information on species pulled from online
sources.

###### Example

```r
testgroup <- gather_group_for_species (species_list_csv = "species_test.csv")
```

######Longer version with explanations
Knowing higher order groupings may aid in finding needed data (e.g., averaging 
trophic level across genus for missing species) or to build functional groupings.

#####gather_data_for_species
######Short version
Provide 

* name and location (defaults to working directory) of a .csv file that has a list of species to be included. File needs to have columns labelled
    * Genus
    * species
    * common_name
    These may be blank for some speciesbut column must be included

Function should return a .csv file with information on species pulled from online
sources (Fishbase and Sealifebase currently, expanding to other sources)

###### Example

```r
testdata <- gather_data_for_species (species_list_csv = "species_test.csv")
```

######Longer version with explanations
Atlantis requires a variety of data for each group.  The main traits models tend 
to focus on are those needed to model population growth and interactions.  These include:

* Trophic level and consumption rate
* Diet composition
* Mortality rates (natural and fishing may be needed)
* Growth parameters (k, relationship between length and weight)
* Size and age parameters (maximum length, maximum age)
* developmental information (age/size at maturity)


#####gather_interactions_for_species
######Short version
Provide 
* name and location (defaults to working directory) of a .csv file that has a list of species to be included. File needs to have columns labelled
    * Genus
    * species
    * common_name
    These may be blank for some speciesbut column must be included.  A "functional_group" column may also be included
* name and location(defaults to working directory) of a .shp file that was used to build the .bgm file for Atlantis
OR a bounding box for where interactions should be returned

Function should return a .csv file with information on species interactions pulled 
from online sources (Global Biotic Interaction database currently, expanding to other sources)

###### Example

```r
testinteractions <- gather_interactions_for_species (species_list_csv = "species_test.csv")

```

######Longer version with explanations
Atlantis requires a trophic model for all included functional groups (i.e., who
eats who and how often).   This function can be used to construct or check functional
groups by ensuring major trophic pathways are included appropriately

#####gather_habitat_for_species
######Short version
Provide 
* name and location (defaults to working directory) of a .csv file that has a list of species to be included. File needs to have columns labelled
    * Genus
    * species
    * common_name
    These may be blank for some speciesbut column must be included. A "functional_group" column may also be included
* name and location of a .shp file that was used to build the .bgm file for Atlantis
* (optional) list of key words to search for in Fishbase description

Function should return a .csv file with information on species occurrences pulled 
from online sources, including which species met certain depth parameters, keyword
searches, and had been geotagged in each of your map polygons.  

###### Example

```r
testhabitat <- gather_habitat_for_species(species_list_csv = "species_test.csv")
```

######Longer version with explanations
Understanding where each species occurs (depth and location) can be useful in determining
functional groups and initial biomass starting locations.  This function currently 
queries FishBase and several online sources of location data (gbif, iNaturalist 
and more using the spocc package). 

######Comments
The data.table package need to be installed independently (needed when message
```r
there is no package called 'data.table'
```
appears)

#####create_functional_groups

######Short version
Provide 

* name and location (defaults to working directory) of a .csv file that has a list of species to be included and 
basic information.  Columns that must be included are:
    * Phylogenetic information, specifically
        * Genus
        * species
        * family
        * order
        * class
        * superclass
        * phylum
    * Tropic level information, specifically at least one of the following
        * TrophicLevel
        * FoodTroph
        * DietTroph
    * Data on depth associations, specifically
        * Min_Depth
        * Max_Depth
* Information on bathymetry levels used in the Atlantis model. These can be directly
provided (via bathymetry_levels argument) or pulled from an Atlantis model shape file
for which users specify the location (map_location) and name (map_name)
* list of habitat types (habitat_list) to be included in the model 

###### Example

```r
test_groups <- create_functional_groups(species_info_csv = "test_combined.csv",
                          habitat_list = c("SeaGrassBeds", "CoralReefs", "Sand", "Mud" ))
```

######Longer version with explanations
Like any ecosystem model, Atlantis must balance simplicity and the need for details.
Once collected, species trait, interaction, and habitat data are used to divied species
into groups with appropriate parameter (often averaged for the group).  This function
uses data on taxonomy, trophic level, and habitat and depth associations to suggest 
groupings.

###File creation

####Short version

File creation is handled in ratlantis by the create_biology_prm function, to which users
provide:

* name and location (defaults to working directory) of a .csv file that has a list of species to be included and 
basic information.  Columns that must be included are:
    * Phylogenetic information, specifically
        * Genus
        * species
        * family
        * order
        * class
        * superclass
        * phylum
    * Tropic level information, specifically at least one of the following
        * TrophicLevel
        * FoodTroph
        * DietTroph
    * Data on depth associations, specifically
        * Min_Depth
        * Max_Depth
    * Atlantis_group_type
    * Group_name


#### Example

```r

```

####Longer version with explanations


####Comments

Key models and related assumptions that are commonly 
used include the Von Bertalannfy Growth Equation:

$Length_t = Length_{max}^{(1-e^k(t-t_0))}$

and related weight equation, and the relationship between length and weight

$W=aL^b$

Mortality can be hard to calculate, so a few simplifiying assumptions allow us to 
get:

$$M = {ln(.01)\over-{T_{max}}}$$

where $T_{max}$ is the age of oldest individual.  

All of this data may be entirely provided by the user or (much more commonly) pulled
from existing datasets and amended as needed. The suite of functions we just documented
(gather_data_for_species, gather_habitat_for species, gather_interactions_for_data)
all pull together this data, BUT IT IS UP TO THE USER TO VERIFY IT AND DETERMINE
HOW TO USE IT. We recommend a workflow of:

* initial classification of species into focal groups based on model needs
    * this may be assisted using the create_functional_groups function, which 
  creates groups based on trophic level, basic biological group, and depth usage
* review this initial list by considering interactions and habitat usage
  *this can be considered by merging data you've acquired by focus group to make 
  sure the groups make sense
* generate the averaged traits for each functional groups and actual parameters 
used in Atlantis bio.prm file and create the bio.prm and groups.csv input files
    * the create_biology_prm function carries out both these tasks
* reiterate this process (create groups, check values) until you are pleased

One of the major benefits of the ratlantis package will be the 
ability to consider multiple focus group considerations for one model (since much 
of the calibration and model creation will be automated), allowing models to be 
quickly reconfigured.  The same perspective should apply for changing model areas
(downscaling a model or changing polygons).

######Atlantis notes

Before setting groups, a few specific Atlantis model properties should be understood. 
Groups are categorized as:
*Vertebrates
 *FISH
 *BIRD
 *MAMMAL
 *SHARK
*Invertebrates
  *a long list that can be found at https://wiki.csiro.au/display/Atlantis/AtlantisGroupTypes
  
Group type determines where organisms are found (in sediment, in water column, epibenthic)
and how often they are processed.  Focal groups are also either composed of singe 
pools or some number of structured size classes. These two concepts are tied together
in the model code; vertebrates can have multiple (unlimited, formerly 10) age classes,
while invertebrates can only have pools or two age classes.  FOR THIS REASON, YOU MAY
SEE INVERTEBRATES CLASSIFIED AS VERTEBRATS IN THE MODEL (e.g., if you need to model
3+ size classes for shrimp, crabs, etc, you'll have to tell the model they are a 
vertebrate).  Similarly, the group.csv file (one of the required input files) has 
an invert_type column where you label the group type (so some rows will say FISH 
or other non-invertebrate groups).  

ratlantis deals with this by asking how many 
cohorts you want to include for a species and then attempting to classify it into the right Atlantis group for you.
You should note you are required to have one (and only one) of the following groups
in each model:
*CARRION, carrion
*LAB_DET, labile detritus
*REF_DET, refractory detritus
*PL_BACT - Pelagic Bacteria
*SED_BACT - Sediment Bacteria

These respresent the detrital and bacterial components of the ecosystem.  



## Atlantis Steps:  Model Execution

####Short version
Provide 
-This code assumes you have downloaded and compiled the C++ Atlantis code and requires
--the location of the compliled Atlantis code
--the name of the .exe file created by Atlanits code (e.g., atlantismain)
--the names of files you have created to run Atlantis (which are stored in same 
folder at the .exe file)
---biology_nc, the biology initial conditions file 
---run_file_prm, the initial conditions run file 
---forcing_time_series_prm, the file detailing initial forcings 
---physics_prm, the initial physics file detailing eddies and scaling
---biology_prm, the biology parameter file
---harvest_prm, the harvest file
---functional_group_csv, the list of functional groups
---fisheries_csv, the list delimiting targeted fisheries 

The above are all created via code in ratlantis.  You must also provide
-output_file_nc, desired name for output file
-output_folder, folder where should results be stored

Function will call the system shell and execute Atlantis

#### Example

```r
execute_atlantis(atlantis_location = "C:/exampleatlantis", atlantis_exe = "atlantismain",
                              biology_nc ="init_VMPA_setas_25032013.nc",
                              output_file_nc = "outputSETAS.nc", run_file_prm =
                                "VMPA_setas_run_fishing_F_New.prm",
                              forcing_time_series_prm = "VMPA_setas_force_fish.prm",
                              physics_prm = "VMPA_setas_physics.prm", biology_prm
                              = "VMPA_setas_biol_fishing_New.prm",harvest_prm =
                                "VMPA_setas_harvest_F_New.prm",
                              functional_group_csv = "SETasGroups.csv",
                              fisheries_csv = "SETasFisheries.csv",
                              output_folder = "Outputfoldertest")

```

Atlantis is a C++ program.  This code does not recreate Atlantis in R, it simply 
acts as a wrapper for the program.
